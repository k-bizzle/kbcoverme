          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>I was born and raised in Morgan Hill, CA and graduated a proud Acorn! Moved to Paso Robles, CA and
            after a brief stint working at the Lake Nacimiento Resort General Store, I was hired at TCSN, the local
            internet
            service provider. I stepped into an accounting role and eventually moved on to Case Pacific Company where I
            developed and honed my construction accounting and payroll skills. After a decade, or so, I added real
            estate to the mix
            and focused on that for a few years, along with a new family. I went back to assist the owners at TCSN and
            Case Pacific for some years while doing real estate. </p>

            <p> I eventually found my way into the insurance industry via Gregory Byrne Insurance Agency - Farmers
              Insurance. Insurance came pretty easy with my background and being able to help people was a bonus I
              didn't realize would come! I am so glad I found a career that I love and even happier that I get to have a
              positive impact on people's lives. I've been in the insurance industry for 4 years now and have decided to
              transition and specialize in Life Insurance and help where I'm needed most. At some point, everyone of us
              has watched a family struggle financialy after the loss of a loved one. Life Insurance will be the most
              important thing you've ever done for your family.</p>

                <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
                  <li> <strong>Saving Money:</strong> Here you'll put some of your money into it regularly, just like
                    saving coins in a piggy bank. This money grows over time, allowing you to build up a nice nest egg
                    for
                    the future.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Keeping Your Family Safe: </strong> If something happens to you, the insurance part of the
                    plan helps make sure your family has enough money to take care of things like paying the mortgage,
                    bills, or going to school.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong> Watching the Stock Market: </strong>Another cool thing about this plan is that it pays
                    attention to how well the stock market is doing. If the stock market goes up, your savings can grow
                    even faster. And if it goes down, your money stays safe and <strong>doesn't lose value.</strong>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Making Choices: </strong> With this plan, you get to choose how much money you want to put
                    in
                    and how your family gets helped if something happens to you. You can also change your mind later if
                    you want to.

                  <li>
                    <strong>Safe Saving: </strong>Annuities are like a safe or vault you put your money in. With fixed
                    index annuities, you put your money into this account, and it's protected from getting lost or
                    stolen.
                  </li>
                  <li> <strong> Investing with a Twist: </strong> The interesting part is that they're also connected to
                    the stock market. Instead of directly investing in stocks, your money is tied to how well certain
                    parts of the stock market do. So, if the stock market goes up, your money grows, but if it goes
                    down,
                    <strong>your money stays safe and doesn't decrease in value.</strong>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Growth Potential: </strong> Because these are linked to the stock market, when
                    it does well, your account can grow faster than if it were just sitting in a regular savings
                    account.
                    But remember, even if the stock market goes down, your money is protected from losing value.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong> Accessing Your Money: </strong>You usually can't take it all out at once. It's meant to be
                    a
                    long-term investment, like saving up for college or retirement. However, you can usually take out a
                    portion of your money each year if you need it for something important.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>
                      Choosing Your Strategy: </strong> You can pick different strategies for how your money is
                    invested.
                    Some might focus on growth, while others might prioritize safety. It's important to understand your
                    options and choose a strategy that fits your financial goals and risk tolerance.

                  <li>
                    <strong> Safety Net for Loved Ones: </strong>When you have a whole life insurance policy, your
                    family
                    gets a lump sum of money, called a death benefit, if you pass away. This money can help cover things
                    like funeral costs, bills, and living expenses, so your family doesn't have to worry during a tough
                    time.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong> Savings for the Future:</strong> This also helps you save money for the future. Every time
                    you pay your insurance premium, a portion goes into a savings account within your policy. This
                    savings
                    account grows over time and earns interest. You can borrow or even withdraw some money later in life
                    if you need it for things like buying a home or paying for college.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong> Guaranteed Benefits: </strong> Whole Life comes with guaranteed benefits. As long as you
                    keep
                    paying your premiums, the insurance company guarantees to pay out the death benefit to your family
                    when you pass away, and the cash value in your policy keeps growing steadily over time.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong> Lifetime Coverage: </strong> Whole life insurance provides coverage for your entire life.
                    This
                    means that no matter how old you get or if your health changes, as long as you keep paying your
                    premiums, your policy stays in place and your family remains protected.

                  <li>
                    <strong>Renting Protection: </strong> Think of term insurance as renting a safety net for your
                    family.
                    When you get a term life insurance policy, you're paying a monthly or yearly fee, called a
                    premium, to the insurance company. In return, they promise to pay a lump sum of money, known as the
                    death benefit, to your family if you pass away during the term of the policy.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Coverage for a Set Time: </strong> Term insurance provides coverage for a specific period,
                    usually ranging from 10 to 30 years. It's like
                    renting a safety net for a certain amount of time, such as until your kids are grown up or your
                    mortgage is paid off.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Affordable Protection: </strong>This coverage is usually more affordable than whole life
                    insurance because it's temporary and doesn't include a savings component.This is a budget-friendly
                    option, especially for young adults or families on a tight budget.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Simple and Flexible: </strong>You choose the length of the term and the amount of coverage
                    you
                    need based on your financial responsibilities and goals. You can usually renew or extend your policy
                    at the end
                    of the term if you still need coverage.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Focused Protection: </strong>Term insurance is designed to provide financial protection
                    during
                    specific life stages or events, such as raising children, paying off debts, or covering a mortgage.
                    It's like having extra protection when you need it most, without paying for coverage you might not
                    need later on.

                      insurance policy, you're putting money aside to make sure your loved ones don't have to worry
                      about paying for things like funeral expenses, burial or cremation costs, medical bills, or any
                      other
                      final expenses.

                        Small, Affordable Payments: </strong>Final expense insurance is usually affordable and easy to
                      manage. You pay a small monthly premium to the insurance company, kind of like saving up pocket
                      money
                      each month. This money goes into a special fund that's set aside to cover your final expenses when
                      the
                      time comes.</li>
                    <li><strong>
                        Peace of Mind for Your Loved Ones: </strong> It's like leaving behind a gift for your loved
                      ones, so
                      they don't have to worry about finding the money to pay
                      for your funeral or other expenses during a difficult time.</li>
                    <li><strong>
                        No Medical Exam Needed: </strong>Unlike some other types of insurance, final expense insurance
                      typically
                      doesn't require a medical exam or extensive health questions. This makes it easier to qualify for
                      coverage, even if you have pre-existing health conditions or are older.</li>
